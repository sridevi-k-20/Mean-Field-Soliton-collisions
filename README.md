# Mean-Field-Soliton-collisions
The two XMDS codes provided in the repository models mean-field collisions of two solitions with initial phase difference equal to ==0== and ==pi==. When the initial phase difference is zero, the two solitons behave attractively with a density peak at the intersection, and if the phase difference is pi, then the two solitons behave repulsively.
